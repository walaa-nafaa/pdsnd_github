### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Explorer (CLI Version)


---

### Description
This project is a command-line Python application that explores US bikeshare data for three major cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**.

The program allows users to interactively select filters (city, month, and day) and then computes descriptive statistics related to:
- Most frequent travel times
- Most popular stations and trips
- Total and average trip duration
- User demographics (user type, gender, and birth year when available)

The application processes CSV datasets using **pandas** and presents results directly in the terminal with clear, structured output.  
It also supports viewing raw data incrementally (5 rows at a time) and gracefully handles missing data fields in certain datasets.
